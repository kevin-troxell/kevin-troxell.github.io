Choosing a bank partner is an important part of building a financial platform. If you don't have a bank, 

1) You're not FDIC insured, so your customers deposits are not insured. 
2) You're losing out on cash to leverage on whatever financial product you're building.

The question is, how do you choose a Bank? Do you go with established finbank players like Cross River, Evolve Bank and Trust, and WebBank? Or do you go with a look-a-like? Use the tool below to explore similar banks to your selection.
